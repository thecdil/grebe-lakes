Increased levels of predation (crows and gulls) and nests destroyed by wind. Possible threats also nutrient loading and heavy metals. Human disturbance from fishing and boating was a greater threat in the past than recently. Nest initiation (started June 1), nest monitoring, and disturbance surveys were weekly.

The thirteen birds from Clear Lake had higher (double) mercury concentrations in kidney, breast muscle and brain tissue than birds taken from the other lakes.   However, mercury concentrations in livers were not statistically different. An abandoned mercury mine within the Clear Lake watershed caused elevated mercury levels in sediment and fish in the lake. Grebe productivity was much lower at Clear Lake than at the other two lakes but not clear why. Disturbance and bioaccumulation of compounds including mercury could impact productivity. There are many boaters, skiers, and anglers at that lake. In comparison, Eagle lake has less boat use that is more concentrated at the center of the lake and Tule Lake lacks boating activity. Grebe productivity was also monitored for 3 years from the three lakes. Grebes were surveyed once in 1992, then once per month between June to September in 1993 and 1994.

Historical information provided: in 1910, ""large #s"" of Western grebes were nesting there (Finley 1911), in the 1940's, >1,000 pairs (2,000 estimated breeding adults) according to A.H. Miller (Hunt and Bischoff 1960), but then in 1967, the colony was limited to one tule marsh.  Clutch size dropped 13% from 1967 to 1975 from 2.42 to 2.10 eggs. In 1975, clutches were no greater than 3 eggs. In 1975, 7 eggs were collected to measure eggshell thickness and they were significantly thin-shelled (except for one egg). This article names the major threats to grebes on this lake over time as these 3: various periods of pesticide use starting on 1949 to rid Clear Lake gnats and subsequent reproductive failure and disappearance of breeding grebes, the introduction of Mississippi silversides to control gnats and their competition with the grebes' prey fish (young centrachids) from which the grebes never switched from as prey, and the destruction of emergent vegetation that was traditional nesting habitat due to commercial development of the shoreline. From Table 1, colony is not protected, recreation is main usage, degree of shoreline development is high, and spring water level stability considered usually stable with high winds."

Also, in 1997 and 2002, most grebe nests were destroyed possibly due to airboat use for weed control operations (D. Anderson, pers. comm.). DDD contaminants may have resulted in high adult mortality (Herman et al. 1969) but there may have been stress from mercury and other additional contaminants as well (Suchanek et al. 2002).

DDD treatments to eradicate Clear Lake gnats were conducted in 1949, 1954, and 1957 which impacted nesting Western grebes (Herman et al. 1969).  100 dead grebes were found in 1954 and 75 dead grebes were found in 1957.  In 1958, fish were tested and had very high DDD concentrations.  There was a major crash in grebe breeding populations.  Before 1949, there were over 1000 estimated pairs of breeding grebes on the lake.  From 1958 to 1959, there were less than 25 pairs observed and no nesting nor chicks found (Hunt and Bischoff 1960).  Concentrations of DDD were found to be about 80,000 to 85,000 fold higher in grebes than the surrounding water (Lindquist and Roth 1950, Rudd 1964) and this was the first evidence of bioaccumulation in food webs and delayed toxic symptoms of pesticide concentrations (Carson 1962, Rudd 1964).  These grebes were declining at the same time of mercury mining in the 1950s yet no one at the time connected grebe declines to mercury concentrations.  This paper was evaluating museum specimens of grebes from Clear Lake at that time to determine mercury levels then.  The cycle of threadfin shad abundance and declines after their introduction to the lake also seems to have an effect of Western grebe populuations.  Colwell et al. (1977) demonstrated a strong positive correlation between threadfin shad abundance and piscivorious birds including Western and Clark's grebes."

Win-generated waves inundated and destroyed approximately 35% of nests in a year and were a major threat of nests.  Egg predation by avian and mammalian predators was also a cause of nest failure.  Clear Lake has been particularly impacted by adverse anthropogenic activity such as acid mine drainage and mining activities that leached mercury into the lake, the use of dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD) to control Clear Lake gnat populations, introduced nonnative fishes, and the destruction of wetland habitats to development.

Nesting was observed at four nest sites, disturbances and grebe response was measured and quanitifed.  Boats and aircraft resulted in the most frequest response from grebes but less so if non-motorized.  However, non-human and non-seen disturbances caused the most responses by grebes.  Disturbance source distance was the most significant variable to cause grebe response.  Moderate and varied speed of boats and boats less than 10 meters from the colony were also major factors in grebe response.  This study utilized opportunistic observations and had no control over sample size but had the advantage of observing grebes in real time disturbance events.  Grebe nesting in isolated sites were less impacted by boat disturbances.  However, some grebes still selected high disturbance sites because there might be some trade offs there, such as mammal predator avoidance of areas where human activity was higher.  Though there may be some tolerance to human presence by grebes, human activity may limit full grebe population recovery and nesting potential. Establishing buffer zones around nesting areas would be a management action to protect grebe nesting activity.  "

Grebe productivity was much lower at Clear Lake than at the other two lakes but not clear why. For the duration of this study, the grebes at Eagle Lake and Tule Lake are thought to be reproducing normally. Eagle Lake has less boat use that is more concentrated at the center of the lake and Tule Lake lacks boating activity. Grebe productivity was also monitored for 3 years from the three lakes. Grebes were surveyed once per month between June to September in 1993 and 1994 at Eagle Lake.

Habitat availability was analyzed and determined to have peaked in 1998 and declined since throughout the study period. The lowest habitat availability was in 2010 when it declined by 93% since 1998. 2010 also demonstrated the lowest habitat quality measurement, having declined by 86% from the highest habitat quality estimate in 2002. No adult nor chick counts in this brief article but productivity is reported as lowest in 2007 (0.087) and 2010 (0.054) representing a 87% and 92% decline respectively from the highest productivity of 0.67 for 2002. The top model showed a positive relationship between grebe reproductive output and habitat availability, which was also the most important value. Not as important but also showing a positive relationship with reproductive output was habitat quality. Lake level was not a direct predictor of grebe reproductive output, but was strongly correlated with habitat availability and quality. Long-term lake level stabilization might even be detrimental to grebe nesting habitat due to its impact on emergent vegetation growth, structure and composition (LaPorte et al. 2014). However, major fluctuations in water levels within a breeding season can negatively effect grebe nesting."

Other piscivorous birds were surveyed as well and all populations numbers decreased from Gould and Koplin's numbers.  Recreation and other human activity have increased over the years at Eagle Lake and high water levels limited nesting habitat.  The delay of peak nesting by 3 to 4 weeks may have coincided with a peak in recreation during the summer.  Some of these threats are general to grebes and other piscivorous birds.

Morphometry and molt data, along with blood was collected from each bird for mercury analysis, and sex determination via genetic analysis.

An egg from each randomly sampled nest was collected either from an active nest (random egg) or from an abandoned nest (abandoned egg). Prey fish and sport fish were also sampled an average of 11 days after grebe sampling. At East Park Reservoir, all tissues were collected in 2012 (Figure SI). 354 grebes were captured total from the 25 lakes, 71% were Western grebes, 29% were Clark's, 48% were female, 52% were male. 101 grebe eggs were collected from 7 lakes, of which 62% were Western grebes, 15% were Clark's grebes, 23% were unidentified which. Grebe blood, eggs, and sport fish mercury concentrations were strongly correlated to mercury concentrations in prey fish at the lakes. Grebe mercury concentrations were also strongly correlated with sport fish mercury concentrations. This study showed that prey fish monitoring can estimate mercury exposure of grebes and other piscivorous birds if these birds can't be sampled directly."

States that primary factor of reproductive success is the rate of water drawdown during the breeding season. Water level change within and amongst years was greatest at this lake. If water level drops greater than 0,06 (0.72"") per day from June 25 to September 15, adult to juvenile ratio is <0.5, resulting in eventual population decline. This report postulates that grebes are drawn to this lake due to fish prey (mostly pond smelt) and abundant breeding habitat at all water levels (~4,478 to 4,493 feet from June to September 15, 2010 to 2014).  The lake then acts as an ecological trap due to the rate of water drop. Compared 2010 to 2013 data with that reported in Kyle 2013 and there were a couple of discrepencies (Kyle's report had 926 nests and 577 estimated young in 2012) but these were neither minimum, maximum nor recent counts for this entry. Entered Table 4 only but the adult #s were late season counts in September or October.  Therefore may need to rethink whether to enter earlier survey #s than these and recalculate reproductive rate. Some of these adult numbers might have captured migration.  Kyle's report didn't have this breakdown of adult #s per survey date in the season. In 2013, this lake had the most nests out of any of the studied lakes for all observed years but the young produced that year was like that of 2011 (with only 20% of the number of nests).

It is believed that grebes started nesting there after pond smelt, a species native to Japan, was introduced there in 1972 and 1979.  However, long-time residents there report seeing grebes nesting there starting in the 1950s.  Disturbance and camera surveys were conducted at Lake Almanor to provide a fuller picture of issues impacting grebes.  Water elevation changes were the largest at Lake Almanor compared to the other lakes in this report.  Water drawdown was at a rate of -0.78 inches/day.

Additional survey method was from the peak of a nearby mountain.  Grebes started nesting at Lake Hodges in 2001.  In 2018, a pump station started to move water between Oliverhein Reservoir and Lake Hodges by the management agencies.  Brian Cladwell informed the pump station operators that grebe nests were failing due to the drawdown of water but there was no action to resolve this and the nest colony failed that year.  In 2019, the nest colony failed twice again with the water pumpiing.  With the first nest colony failure, Brian Caldwell again informed the pump station operators that nesting was taking place but no action was taken.  With the second nest colony failure, ten environmental groups lobbied the California Department of Fish and Wildlife to enact water level protocals.  The third nest colony produced chicks.  Chick number counts were not provided in this report so it is estimated as 1 to 3 chicks per brood.

Shuford to paraphrase: ""Mono is hypersaline and hence lacks any fish and also has no vegetation in the lake for building or attaching nests. It has gotten more saline over time because of water diversions to its inflowing streams, but, regardless, I don’t believe there have ever been fish in Mono Lake in historical times. Perhaps a report of nesting from “Mono Lake” refers to some other site nearby in Mono County? Consultation with Greg Reis and Rene Corado of WFVZ and Rene says Dixon’s egg collecting notes from June 1938, 1939 and 1940, we only have notes on eggs he collected, he doesn’t mention any western grebes (probably because he didn’t collected eggs).

In April 1976, spring population estimate is 0 (Table 1) and normally I wouldn't enter this because it is not during breeding season but the narrative for this lake describes absence of adult Western grebes so I entered 0.  1976 productivity (# hatchlings) is a ""0"" though the narrative says there were many reports of a young and eggs observed so a small colony could've been missed by observers. Historical information provided from Grinnell and Miller 1944 states that nesting was sporadic. The lake is not along traditional Western grebe migration routes, possibly inhibiting grebe usage during breeding season. The lake is high salinity which could impact reproduction. From Table 1, colony is protected, recreation and wildlife refuge are main uses of lake, there is no shoreline development, spring water level stability is stable with high winds."

Mercury concentrations were analyzed from liver, kidney and breast muscle.  No info on how many birds were taken from Eagle Lake and Tule Lake but thirteen birds taken from Clear Lake had higher (double) mercury concentrations in kidney, breast muscle and brain tissue than birds taken from the other lakes.  However, mercury concentrations in livers were not statistically different. An abandoned mercury mine within the Clear Lake watershed caused elevated mercury levels in sediment and fish in the lake. Grebe productivity was much lower at Clear Lake than at the other two lakes but not clear why. For the duration of this study, the grebes at Eagle Lake and Tule Lake are thought to be reproducing normally. Eagle Lake has less boat use that is more concentrated at the center of the lake and Tule Lake lacks boating activity. Grebe productivity was also monitored for 3 years from the three lakes. Grebes were surveyed once in 1992, then once per month between June to September in 1993 and 1994. About 50 to 75% of the total population of grebe adults and young were counted by spotting scope (ground) and productivity was calculated.

Averaged 65 surveys/year across these 6 lakes for 4 breeding seasons from 2010 to 2013. Steady increase in # adults until 2013 for all lakes except Eagle Lake (likely due to low water levels). Observed active nests also increased through study period except collapse at Eagle Lake. Estimated average productivity (young:adult) was 0.19 for all 6 lakes. If Eagle Lake was excluded due to no reproduction 2012 to 2013, productivity of the other 5 lakes was 0.27. The Audubon chapters conclude from the disturbance surveys that in most years, natural predation, water flux, food availability (not measured) have more impact on the grebes than human disturbance (boats, kayaks, dog walkers, planes). The report also states that water level fluctuations is one of the major factors impacting grebe reproductive success and water level management protocals are urgent. They hope to negotiate with power producers to include grebes into water management plans for the summer/breeding season. These chapters do extensive outreach into the communities, including signage, education, and other ways to advocate for grebes."

This updated estimate is greater than previously reported and includes additional lakes than previously reported.  The Western grebe is listed as Threatened in Alberta due to >30% decline in ten years, colony loss, reduction of quality nesting habitat, and other factors.  Lack of nesting habitat is considered the key threat.  Prescott et al. (2018) reported additional records from 2015 to 2016.  Erickson et al. (2014 and 2017) found that the presence of Western grebes was positively correlated with shore bulrush extent.  This Alberta recovery plan asserts the lack of long term surveys and research on these grebes.  In Alberta, 318 lakes had current or previous Western grebes during the breeding season.  Of these lakes, 67 lakes had confirmed breeding at least once (Prescott et al. 2018).  There are many additional smaller waterbodies that may also support grebes.  Therefore, the previous report of 13 out of 26 lakes who once supported a colony of >= 100 birds and no longer do with no replacement lakes is not accurate anymore.  However, declines are stil occurring elsewhere, over the winter, or due to a shift, but there are declines reportted in southern Manitoba and British Columbia in Canada and Washington and northern California in the United States.  Alberta conducts outreach to promote awareness of grebes and codifies grebe nesting protection in regulations.  For example, oil and gas development is restricted from 1000 meters from grebe nesting in boreal forests and foothills.  Alberta government grebe conservation efforts include prioritizing potential, current, and unoccupied breeding habitat.  A goal is to compile new and existing data on occupancy of lakes by grebes.  Grebe protection efforts also benefits other waterbirds, waterfowl, songbirds, and fish and has no negative consequences."

From the Appendix, I entered only lakes (67) with evidence of breeding (either chicks or nests, but doesn't specify which and no nest nor chick numbers provided).  Otherwise, 318 lakes supported adult grebe populations.  This report compiled a list of 35 priority lakes for grebe surveys and management actions through the provincial recovery plan based on high population and habitat scores.  New lakes with breeding reveal a changing system of lake occupancy and possibly higher populations than previously thought in Alberta."

An oil spill in August 2005 killed 69% of the breeding grebe population (ASRD/ACA 2006).  Considered an important breeding site in Canada.

Leach Lake has 2% of the grebes of the CVWMA complex.  Considered the most protected nesting sites in B.C. due to the Creston Valley Wildlife Act.  Western grebe research was high priority for the CVWMA but the federal government withdrew funding and no work continued on the grebes since 1990.  Infestation of milfoil weed limits open water for foraging.  The  cause(s) of low breeding success of grebes remains unknown."

At the mouth of the Fraser River, the marshes have brackish water and have a mean tidal range of 3.1 m to 4.8 m at the extreme, making it a challenge to nest there.  The chicks were observed late in the season, suggesting they may have hatched from renesting efforts after an unsuccessful nesting attempt.  They could have also hatched from nests further up the Fraser River but that is unlikely.  Most summers, there are 50 to 100 grebes in the summer near Westham Island but no evidence of breeding before 1986."

Waterbirds: The International Journal of Waterbird Biology, 37(1), 30–42. http://www.jstor.org/stable/24640958",,Thesis,"Comparison study in 2009 and 2010 compared to 1973 and 1974 (Nuechterlein 1975) grebe survey.  Though adult count numbers remain fairly stable and even increased, 2009 and 2010's reduced breeding success is attributed to wave action.  Other threats, some related to generating or mitigating waves, include spawning common carp, depradation, changes in vegetation structure (nesting habitat quality), and low water levels.  This marsh is connected to Lake Manitoba and was considered a historically high productive area for grebes, with a nest success rate of 84% and productivity rate of 0.88 in 1974 (Nuechterlein 1975).  After Nuechterlein's study, there's been a lack of grebe surveys until 2005 (Underwood and Rasmussen, 2005).  There's been one-day surveys from an airboat in part of Delta Marsh in June 2005, 2006 and 2007 conducted by Ducks Unlimited Canada (DUC) and the Canadian Wildlife Service (CWS).  I did not enter these numbers cited here because those sound like partial surveys.  Counts were 346 nests in 2005 (Underwood and Rasmussen 2005, unpublished data), 307 nests in 2006 (Bazin et al. 2006, unpublished data), and 588 nests in 2007 (Basin et al. 2007, unpublished data).  Nuechterlein named three major factors to nest success for his tudy, wave impacts, water depth, and emergent vegetation stem density.  Since the last 40 years from LaPorte's study, an invasive hybrid cattail (Typha x glauca)  was outcompeting native shoreline vegetation and growing in dense monotypic stands.  Otherwise, nesting was predominantly in bulrush in 1973 and 1974.  Low water levels made these hybrid cattail stands impenetrable to grebes as nesting habitat.  A decrease in submerged vegetation in the open water since the 1970s also reduces the buffer to wave energy.  Water turbidity also increased due to carp presence which can limit visibility for foraging grebes.  Carp barriers between the marsh and Lake Manitoba can also drown grebes moving between the two waterbodies.  Nuechterlein attributed better breeding success in 1974 relative to 1973 to higher water levels in 1974, which increased quality and quantity of nesting habitat.  1973, along with 2010 were considered low water years while 1974 and 2009 were high water years.  In 1973, a low water year, nests were exposed and impacted by high winds, resulting in less nest success than in 1974.  In a low water year at Delta marsh, breeding success was ~50% less than a high water year even if water levels were ~30 cm higher at the start of the nesting season (Nuechterlein 1975).  A sampling of nests for nest success showed that nest success of 84% in 1974 was significantly higher than 49% in 2009 and 43% in 2010.  There were a variety of threats to nests in 2009 and 2010 but the top three were wave impacts, destruction by spawning carp, and abandonment due to low water levels.  The 2009 adult and chick counts include Lake Manitoba because of the channel connection between the two areas.  LaPorte also cites the multi-modality of clutch initiations in 2009 and 2010 to increased rates of nest failures from wave impacts from storms and the renesting that occurs.  Abandonment rates due to researcher disturbance in 2009 and 2010 was greatly reduced by nearly 76% from the 1970s surveys.  LaPorte also states that controlled water drawdowns are also  beneficial to bolster bulrush growth though low water levels negatively impoact grebe nesting."

In 1973, there was low marsh water levels which limited accessible nesting habitat.  It is hypothesized that this caused grebes to nest in less optimal nesting habitat vulnerable to wind and wave inundation.  Predation was not thought to have a major impact on nest success.  However, colonies near canoe passages were vulnerable to human disturbance and nests were abandoned at a higher rate."

All sampled eggs had significant levels of DDE and PCB residues.  DDD was detected in all western grebe egg samples.  They are considered the most piscivorous of the grebes in North America and thus more vulnerable to contaminants.  Western grebe large body mass relative to other grebes also decreases toxicant metabolism.  The DDD, DDE, and PCB levels in the Manitoba lakes were comparable to a larger study in Klamath Basin, California in 1981 (Boellstorff et al. 1985).  Contaminants might be taken up in their wintering and spring grounds."

Three pre-nesting surveys with no count #s conducted from 12 June to 3 July.  Four surveys of colony from 13 June to 5 September.  Only 20 nests marked but probably more due to difficulty of access. Three brood counts from 7 August to 19 September.  The data table for brood count has typo saying 2013.  I entered only 7 August data because other two dates beyond breeding season.  This data will be covered in historical summary of Lake Lowell so the main inclusion of this report is for the threat.

""The JV region encompasses all or portions of Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio, and Wisconsin.""  From species profile: ""The Western Grebe is also a sporadic breeder in the JV region occurring in very low numbers. Except for the western part of BCR 12, there are no historical records for breeding and the species is believed to be a recent arrival in most of the region. Breeding records occur in either sewage ponds or natural shallow wetlands. Species’ presence may be in response to occasional drought conditions farther west in the Dakotas and Nebraska. Small increases in BCRs 22 and 23 in Minnesota are likely attributable to MN DNR’s shallow lake restoration program (e. g., Geneva Lake).

Three sites (unnamed) had nests built along busy roads with no sign of negative effects but observers were only on site for a limited time and longer-term effects are possible.  Clark's grebes were observed at some sites but there was no evidence of them breeding.

He responded to our outreach to him that Upper Klamath Lake was impacted by different challenges from the other sites of the Klamath Basin NWR Complex.  There was a lack of recruitment of juvenile endangered suckers which alters water management.  Water was held higher and at a more stable level than previous years.  However, this negatively impacts submergent and emergent vegetation and reduces nesting habitat.  Remaining stands of emergent vegetation become dislodged and floats away.  Unfortunately, the focus on fish does not consider wetlands, waterbirds, nor the ecological drivers of species declines.  He expressed the need to address these issues at the forefront before additional species are listed, prompting recovery actions. "

Researchers banded 19 Western grebe juveniles and 16 adults in 1973.  Largest reported summer population is here, according to surveys sent out to 5 areas of Utah where >100 Western grebes breed.  The minimum adult and chick counts of 1973 and 1974 are from Table 16 and Table 17 respectively, looking at June through late-August.  840 is reported as the peak adult count between 11 June and 30 July 1974 and 680 is the average of the weekly counts in that period.  I did not include late August and onward counts as the paper called that post-breeding.  Minimum and maximum chick numbers are estimated from Figure 3 starting from mid-June.  This study has separate totals for Class 2 (free swimming) chicks estimated two different ways that I did not enter here.  They are 124 and 158 Class 2 chicks in 1973 and 218 and 269 Class 2 chicks in 1974.  Lindvall calculated nest success using Class 2 chicks per adults.  54% of the total 386 nests were in emergent vegetation, 41% were in open water, and 5% were on dry land.  Table 2 (1973) and Table 3 (1974) provides nest characteristic and nest success data, including threats and their impacts.  Egg predation, nest abandonment, and water level drops are named as the most major threats.  A loss of 25% of total nests to abandonment, including one entire colony, is attributed to a decrease in water levels.  The abandoned colony was located in an area where water level is not managed.

Commercial and centralized oilfield wastewater disposal facilities (COWDFs) utilize vast evaporation pools to capture wastewater produced by oil and natural gas wells.   Birds might mistake these for wetlands and could die if they land in these evaporation pools and are covered in oil.  For this study, 9 of 28 COWDFs in Wyoming were conducted to examine mortality of birds.  Grebes (Family Podicipedidae), incl;uding Western grebes, were amongst the most common bird carcass encountered (28% of total mortalities).  In Campbell County, grebes accounted for 86% of total mortalities.  Western grebes accounted for 6 of the total mortalities.  "
