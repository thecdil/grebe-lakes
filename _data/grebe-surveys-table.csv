Increased levels of predation (crows and gulls) and nests destroyed by wind. Possible threats also nutrient loading and heavy metals. Human disturbance from fishing and boating was a greater threat in the past than recently. Nest initiation (started June 1), nest monitoring, and disturbance surveys were weekly. Average of 65 surveys per year on the 6 lakes for adult grebes, nest attempts and young. One brood survey in Sept for Clear Lake. Number of adults at Clear Lake in 2010 and 2011 is from September survey, and in 2012 and 2013 is from July survey. WEGR and CLGR were distinguished if possible but no breakdown in the data reported.

Historical feather samples taken from museum specimens from 1967 to 1969 by Hermann et al., which measured ~2.3 times greater Hg levels than feathers from 1992.  Fluctuation in Hg levels during 10 year study period.  Total nest failure in 1999 probably due to water drawdown that stranded nests. Low productivity and nest failures in 1993-1995 and 1997 and 1999 were attributed to various disturbances.  Type of disturbances unspecified for 1993-1995 and 1997.  1999 was zero nests due to low water levels. Human disturbance seems to be the most major threat. No major population effects of the Hg on grebes during the study though there is some evidence of Hg toxicity prior to mine remediation. No population data provided, only graph of productivity but no numbers.  Study divided into early (1992–1995) for pre-remediation and late (1996–2001) for post-remediation. Interpreted box plots (figure 4) to estimate approximate # nests as numbers were not provided. Method of surveys were open water (I'm assuming boat) and low-level aerial photography (assuming plane) for species composition, brood sizes, age, and adult to young ratio. Nesting grebe numbers estimated by counting parts of each colony and projecting densities to the whole colony along with assessing through aerial photos.  Colony progress was monitored through the breeding season and compared to Eagle Lake. In 1992, Hg residues in grebes of Clear Lake were higher compared to Eagle Lake and Tule Lake, and near threshold levels that effect reproduction in birds. "

Morphometry and molt data, along with blood was collected from each bird for mercury analysis, and sex determination via genetic analysis.  From 7 out of the 25 lakes, an average of 14 grebe eggs (from 6 to 23 eggs) were collected. An egg from each randomly sampled nest was collected either from an active nest (random egg) or from an abandoned nest (abandoned egg). Prey fish and sport fish were also sampled an average of 11 days after grebe sampling. At Clear Lake, all tissues were collected in 2012 (Figure SI). 354 grebes were captured total from the 25 lakes, 71% were Western grebes, 29% were Clark's, 48% were female, 52% were male. 101 grebe eggs were collected from 7 lakes, of which 62% were Western grebes, 15% were Clark's grebes, 23% were unidentified which. Grebe blood, eggs, and sport fish mercury concentrations were strongly correlated to mercury concentrations in prey fish at the lakes. Grebe mercury concentrations were also strongly correlated with sport fish mercury concentrations. This study showed that prey fish monitoring can estimate mercury exposure of grebes and other piscivorous birds if these birds can't be sampled directly."

Mercury concentrations were analyzed from liver, kidney and breast muscle.  The thirteen birds from Clear Lake had higher (double) mercury concentrations in kidney, breast muscle and brain tissue than birds taken from the other lakes.   However, mercury concentrations in livers were not statistically different. An abandoned mercury mine within the Clear Lake watershed caused elevated mercury levels in sediment and fish in the lake. Grebe productivity was much lower at Clear Lake than at the other two lakes but not clear why. Disturbance and bioaccumulation of compounds including mercury could impact productivity. There are many boaters, skiers, and anglers at that lake. In comparison, Eagle lake has less boat use that is more concentrated at the center of the lake and Tule Lake lacks boating activity. Grebe productivity was also monitored for 3 years from the three lakes. Grebes were surveyed once in 1992, then once per month between June to September in 1993 and 1994. About 50 to 75% of the total population of grebe adults and young were counted by boat and productivity was calculated. Table 2 shows just one summer population count of 3,500 for the 3 years and the productivity rate for each year from 1992 to 1994.

In 1975, clutches were no greater than 3 eggs. In 1975, 7 eggs were collected to measure eggshell thickness and they were significantly thin-shelled (except for one egg). This article names the major threats to grebes on this lake over time as these 3: various periods of pesticide use starting on 1949 to rid Clear Lake gnats and subsequent reproductive failure and disappearance of breeding grebes, the introduction of Mississippi silversides to control gnats and their competition with the grebes' prey fish (young centrachids) from which the grebes never switched from as prey, and the destruction of emergent vegetation that was traditional nesting habitat due to commercial development of the shoreline. From Table 1, colony is not protected, recreation is main usage, degree of shoreline development is high, and spring water level stability considered usually stable with high winds."

Anderson has attributed boating recreation towards colony failures as reproduction has happened in 3 years out of 12-years of grebe monitoring. Also, in 1997 and 2002, most grebe nests were destroyed possibly due to airboat use for weed control operations (D. Anderson, pers. comm.). DDD contaminants may have resulted in high adult mortality (Herman et al. 1969) but there may have been stress from mercury and other additional contaminants as well (Suchanek et al. 2002). DDD presence has degraded but low levels of contamination might persist, causing egg shell thining and population recovered to about half of its levels prior to DDD (D. Anderson, pers. comm.) as of time of this report. On August 20, G. Ivey returned to the Tule Point colony of ~350 nests observed on August 5, and found no evidence of them remaining.

DDD treatments to eradicate Clear Lake gnats were conducted in 1949, 1954, and 1957 which impacted nesting Western grebes (Herman et al. 1969).  100 dead grebes were found in 1954 and 75 dead grebes were found in 1957.  In 1958, fish were tested and had very high DDD concentrations.  There was a major crash in grebe breeding populations.  Before 1949, there were over 1000 estimated pairs of breeding grebes on the lake.  From 1958 to 1959, there were less than 25 pairs observed and no nesting nor chicks found (Hunt and Bischoff 1960).  Concentrations of DDD were found to be about 80,000 to 85,000 fold higher in grebes than the surrounding water (Lindquist and Roth 1950, Rudd 1964) and this was the first evidence of bioaccumulation in food webs and delayed toxic symptoms of pesticide concentrations (Carson 1962, Rudd 1964).  These grebes were declining at the same time of mercury mining in the 1950s yet no one at the time connected grebe declines to mercury concentrations.  This paper was evaluating museum specimens of grebes from Clear Lake at that time to determine mercury levels then.  The cycle of threadfin shad abundance and declines after their introduction to the lake also seems to have an effect of Western grebe populuations.  Colwell et al. (1977) demonstrated a strong positive correlation between threadfin shad abundance and piscivorious birds including Western and Clark's grebes."

Win-generated waves inundated and destroyed approximately 35% of nests in a year and were a major threat of nests.  Egg predation by avian and mammalian predators was also a cause of nest failure.  Clear Lake has been particularly impacted by adverse anthropogenic activity such as acid mine drainage and mining activities that leached mercury into the lake, the use of dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD) to control Clear Lake gnat populations, introduced nonnative fishes, and the destruction of wetland habitats to development.  This paper provides an extensive history of grebe monitoring and surveying over the years and the number of studies conducted at Clear Lake on grebes."

Nesting was observed at four nest sites, disturbances and grebe response was measured and quanitifed.  Boats and aircraft resulted in the most frequest response from grebes but less so if non-motorized.  However, non-human and non-seen disturbances caused the most responses by grebes.  Disturbance source distance was the most significant variable to cause grebe response.  Moderate and varied speed of boats and boats less than 10 meters from the colony were also major factors in grebe response.  This study utilized opportunistic observations and had no control over sample size but had the advantage of observing grebes in real time disturbance events.  Grebe nesting in isolated sites were less impacted by boat disturbances.  However, some grebes still selected high disturbance sites because there might be some trade offs there, such as mammal predator avoidance of areas where human activity was higher.  Though there may be some tolerance to human presence by grebes, human activity may limit full grebe population recovery and nesting potential. Establishing buffer zones around nesting areas would be a management action to protect grebe nesting activity.  "

Historical breeding reference is Tonwsend 1887. Historical information provided: Gould 1974 estimates breeding Western grebes as 3000 to 4000, however this may be an overestimate from aerial surveys. Eagle Lake is described as large, disjunct, and difficult to survey.  Water levels fluctuate much year to year due to changes in seasonal runoff (Gester 1972). However, water levels started to rise due to the ceasing of drawdown for irrigation. This flooding reduced available nesting habitat. No other data provided. From Table 1, colony is not protected, recreation is main use of lake, degree of shoreline development is minimal, spring water level stability is stable, but gradually rising."

Eagle Lake is considered to be a very important site for grebe nesting with possibly the highest numbers in the world (Gould 1974, Shaw 1998) and largest breeding site of CA. It has an average of ""1639 nests from 1970-1997"" (Shaw 1998) and ""1807 from 1996-2003"". This may represent 2.8% of the global population and 22% of the breeding grebes in the Intermountain West (Ivey and Herziger in prep.). Wind and wave threats observed by D. Shaw, pers. comm. and G. Ivey's personal observations. In 2000, nest success was positively correlated to distance from a major boat access and disturbance source and that disturbance negatively impacted clutch size (Sardella 2002). Not sure if this was during breeding season, but avian cholera killed grebes in 1997 at Eagle Lake (National Wildlife Center 1997). A sample of 250 nests monitored on August 23, 2003 showed 118 (52%) hatched, 23 were still being incubated, 15 (6.6%) were most likely depradated, and 94 (41.4%) had no eggs nor eggshell fragments, indicating some kind of failure. There was also evidence of some eggs washed out by waves. Relatively good productivity in 2003 (0.47). Historic productivity up to 2003 ranged from 0.11 to 0.62, averaging 0.43."

Years of exclusion for adult and chick counts (between 1998 and 2010) are 2005 due to lack of data collection and 2007 due to lack of nesting effort. Brood size as a % of n pairs was used to calculate chick count numbers in a given year.  However, only half-grown and larger age classes of chicks were included in the data, therefore chick count numbers may be an underestimate.

The top model showed a positive relationship between grebe reproductive output and habitat availability, which was also the most important value. Not as important but also showing a positive relationship with reproductive output was habitat quality. Lake level was not a direct predictor of grebe reproductive output, but was strongly correlated with habitat availability and quality. Long-term lake level stabilization might even be detrimental to grebe nesting habitat due to its impact on emergent vegetation growth, structure and composition (LaPorte et al. 2014).

States that primary factor of reproductive success is the rate of water drawdown during the breeding season. Water level change within and amongst years was greatest at this lake. If water level drops greater than 0,06 (0.72"") per day from June 25 to September 15, adult to juvenile ratio is <0.5, resulting in eventual population decline. This report postulates that grebes are drawn to this lake due to fish prey (mostly pond smelt) and abundant breeding habitat at all water levels (~4,478 to 4,493 feet from June to September 15, 2010 to 2014).  The lake then acts as an ecological trap due to the rate of water drop. Compared 2010 to 2013 data with that reported in Kyle 2013 and there were a couple of discrepencies (Kyle's report had 926 nests and 577 estimated young in 2012) but these were neither minimum, maximum nor recent counts for this entry. Entered Table 4 only but the adult #s were late season counts in September or October.  Therefore may need to rethink whether to enter earlier survey #s than these and recalculate reproductive rate. Some of these adult numbers might have captured migration.  Kyle's report didn't have this breakdown of adult #s per survey date in the season. In 2013, this lake had the most nests out of any of the studied lakes for all observed years but the young produced that year was like that of 2011 (with only 20% of the number of nests).

Grebe nest success greatly influenced by rate of water drop and recommentaions were for <0.72""/day from 25 June to 15 September as a pilot project with Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) but the complexities of water management and water obligations were challenging.  Therefore, recommendations were modified to <0.84""/day from 1 July to 31 August, restricting boat access, and studying fish populations in the lake.  It is believed that grebes started nesting there after pond smelt, a species native to Japan, was introduced there in 1972 and 1979.  However, long-time residents there report seeing grebes nesting there starting in the 1950s.  Disturbance and camera surveys were conducted at Lake Almanor to provide a fuller picture of issues impacting grebes.  Water elevation changes were the largest at Lake Almanor compared to the other lakes in this report.  Water drawdown was at a rate of -0.78 inches/day.  This lake had the least reproductive success of the lakes in this report but the large numbers of breeding adults resulted in some chicks being produced.  Available fish and nesting habitat seem to be key in attracting large numbers of grebes to this lake.  Observer for these two new years was Arsenault.  Adult number counts reported in this report is the average of survey totals."

At Lake Davis, no grebe eggs were collected in 2012 (Figure SI). 354 grebes were captured total from the 25 lakes, 71% were Western grebes, 29% were Clark's, 48% were female, 52% were male. 101 grebe eggs were collected from 7 lakes, of which 62% were Western grebes, 15% were Clark's grebes, 23% were unidentified which. Grebe blood, eggs, and sport fish mercury concentrations were strongly correlated to mercury concentrations in prey fish at the lakes. Grebe mercury concentrations were also strongly correlated with sport fish mercury concentrations. This study showed that prey fish monitoring can estimate mercury exposure of grebes and other piscivorous birds if these birds can't be sampled directly."

Water drawdown was at a rate of -0.31 inches/day and relatively steady.  This lake is particularly vulnerable to wind storms.  Low water levels and wind storms in 2014 and 2015 caused all nests to fail.  Wind effects on nests were captured on wildlife cameras.  The maximum nest count of 88 in 2016 were estimated from the chick count because the nests were not in areas of previous nesting and they were never located.  Observer for these two new years was Arsenault.  Adult number counts reported in this report is the average of survey totals.

Brian Cladwell informed the pump station operators that grebe nests were failing due to the drawdown of water but there was no action to resolve this and the nest colony failed that year.  In 2019, the nest colony failed twice again with the water pumpiing.  With the first nest colony failure, Brian Caldwell again informed the pump station operators that nesting was taking place but no action was taken.  With the second nest colony failure, ten environmental groups lobbied the California Department of Fish and Wildlife to enact water level protocals.  The third nest colony produced chicks.

Shuford to paraphrase: ""Mono is hypersaline and hence lacks any fish and also has no vegetation in the lake for building or attaching nests. It has gotten more saline over time because of water diversions to its inflowing streams, but, regardless, I don’t believe there have ever been fish in Mono Lake in historical times. Perhaps a report of nesting from “Mono Lake” refers to some other site nearby in Mono County? Consultation with Greg Reis and Rene Corado of WFVZ and Rene says Dixon’s egg collecting notes from June 1938, 1939 and 1940, we only have notes on eggs he collected, he doesn’t mention any western grebes (probably because he didn’t collected eggs). With deleting Mono Lake as a breeding site I’m assuming you are retaining the Mono Basin."""

Mercury concentrations were analyzed from liver, kidney and breast muscle.  No info on how many birds were taken from Eagle Lake and Tule Lake but thirteen birds taken from Clear Lake had higher (double) mercury concentrations in kidney, breast muscle and brain tissue than birds taken from the other lakes.  However, mercury concentrations in livers were not statistically different. An abandoned mercury mine within the Clear Lake watershed caused elevated mercury levels in sediment and fish in the lake. Grebe productivity was much lower at Clear Lake than at the other two lakes but not clear why. For the duration of this study, the grebes at Eagle Lake and Tule Lake are thought to be reproducing normally. Eagle Lake has less boat use that is more concentrated at the center of the lake and Tule Lake lacks boating activity. Grebe productivity was also monitored for 3 years from the three lakes. Grebes were surveyed once in 1992, then once per month between June to September in 1993 and 1994. About 50 to 75% of the total population of grebe adults and young were counted by spotting scope (ground) and productivity was calculated.

About 5.6% of global population of Aechmophorus grebes is supported in Nothern CA.

Averaged 65 surveys/year across these 6 lakes for 4 breeding seasons from 2010 to 2013. Steady increase in # adults until 2013 for all lakes except Eagle Lake (likely due to low water levels). Observed active nests also increased through study period except collapse at Eagle Lake. Estimated average productivity (young:adult) was 0.19 for all 6 lakes. If Eagle Lake was excluded due to no reproduction 2012 to 2013, productivity of the other 5 lakes was 0.27. The Audubon chapters conclude from the disturbance surveys that in most years, natural predation, water flux, food availability (not measured) have more impact on the grebes than human disturbance (boats, kayaks, dog walkers, planes). The report also states that water level fluctuations is one of the major factors impacting grebe reproductive success and water level management protocals are urgent. They hope to negotiate with power producers to include grebes into water management plans for the summer/breeding season. These chapters do extensive outreach into the communities, including signage, education, and other ways to advocate for grebes."

Compared to the 5400 in 2008 from Erickson (2010), this reflects an estimated 76% decline over 40 years of the Alberta breeding population but surveys are intermittent.  Using other estimates reflects an 8 to 27% decline in less than a decade.

This updated estimate is greater than previously reported and includes additional lakes than previously reported.  The Western grebe is listed as Threatened in Alberta due to >30% decline in ten years, colony loss, reduction of quality nesting habitat, and other factors.  Lack of nesting habitat is considered the key threat.  Prescott et al. (2018) reported additional records from 2015 to 2016.  Erickson et al. (2014 and 2017) found that the presence of Western grebes was positively correlated with shore bulrush extent.  This Alberta recovery plan asserts the lack of long term surveys and research on these grebes.  In Alberta, 318 lakes had current or previous Western grebes during the breeding season.  Of these lakes, 67 lakes had confirmed breeding at least once (Prescott et al. 2018).  There are many additional smaller waterbodies that may also support grebes.  Therefore, the previous report of 13 out of 26 lakes who once supported a colony of >= 100 birds and no longer do with no replacement lakes is not accurate anymore.  However, declines are stil occurring elsewhere, over the winter, or due to a shift, but there are declines reportted in southern Manitoba and British Columbia in Canada and Washington and northern California in the United States.  Alberta conducts outreach to promote awareness of grebes and codifies grebe nesting protection in regulations.  For example, oil and gas development is restricted from 1000 meters from grebe nesting in boreal forests and foothills.  Alberta government grebe conservation efforts include prioritizing potential, current, and unoccupied breeding habitat.  A goal is to compile new and existing data on occupancy of lakes by grebes.  Grebe protection efforts also benefits other waterbirds, waterfowl, songbirds, and fish and has no negative consequences."

Known and new colonies were searched for each year through 2009.  This entry is from Table 2 comparing most recent estimate of # adults with highest estimate year.  The highest estimate of # adults in 1971 might include young of year because the count was done after fledging.

Lakes were visited in 2015 and 2016 for occupancy and habitat conditions.  In a given year, if there are multiple sources of data, the highest count was given.  From the Appendix, I entered only lakes (67) with evidence of breeding (either chicks or nests, but doesn't specify which and no nest nor chick numbers provided).  Otherwise, 318 lakes supported adult grebe populations.  This report compiled a list of 35 priority lakes for grebe surveys and management actions through the provincial recovery plan based on high population and habitat scores.  New lakes with breeding reveal a changing system of lake occupancy and possibly higher populations than previously thought in Alberta."

Leach Lake has 2% of the grebes of the CVWMA complex.  Considered the most protected nesting sites in B.C. due to the Creston Valley Wildlife Act.  Western grebe research was high priority for the CVWMA but the federal government withdrew funding and no work continued on the grebes since 1990.  Infestation of milfoil weed limits open water for foraging.  The  cause(s) of low breeding success of grebes remains unknown."

At the mouth of the Fraser River, the marshes have brackish water and have a mean tidal range of 3.1 m to 4.8 m at the extreme, making it a challenge to nest there.  The chicks were observed late in the season, suggesting they may have hatched from renesting efforts after an unsuccessful nesting attempt.  They could have also hatched from nests further up the Fraser River but that is unlikely.  Most summers, there are 50 to 100 grebes in the summer near Westham Island but no evidence of breeding before 1986."

Waterbirds: The International Journal of Waterbird Biology, 37(1), 30–42. http://www.jstor.org/stable/24640958",,Thesis,"Comparison study in 2009 and 2010 compared to 1973 and 1974 (Nuechterlein 1975) grebe survey.  Though adult count numbers remain fairly stable and even increased, 2009 and 2010's reduced breeding success is attributed to wave action.  Other threats, some related to generating or mitigating waves, include spawning common carp, depradation, changes in vegetation structure (nesting habitat quality), and low water levels.  This marsh is connected to Lake Manitoba and was considered a historically high productive area for grebes, with a nest success rate of 84% and productivity rate of 0.88 in 1974 (Nuechterlein 1975).  After Nuechterlein's study, there's been a lack of grebe surveys until 2005 (Underwood and Rasmussen, 2005).  There's been one-day surveys from an airboat in part of Delta Marsh in June 2005, 2006 and 2007 conducted by Ducks Unlimited Canada (DUC) and the Canadian Wildlife Service (CWS).  I did not enter these numbers cited here because those sound like partial surveys.  Counts were 346 nests in 2005 (Underwood and Rasmussen 2005, unpublished data), 307 nests in 2006 (Bazin et al. 2006, unpublished data), and 588 nests in 2007 (Basin et al. 2007, unpublished data).  Nuechterlein named three major factors to nest success for his tudy, wave impacts, water depth, and emergent vegetation stem density.  Since the last 40 years from LaPorte's study, an invasive hybrid cattail (Typha x glauca)  was outcompeting native shoreline vegetation and growing in dense monotypic stands.  Otherwise, nesting was predominantly in bulrush in 1973 and 1974.  Low water levels made these hybrid cattail stands impenetrable to grebes as nesting habitat.  A decrease in submerged vegetation in the open water since the 1970s also reduces the buffer to wave energy.  Water turbidity also increased due to carp presence which can limit visibility for foraging grebes.  Carp barriers between the marsh and Lake Manitoba can also drown grebes moving between the two waterbodies.  Nuechterlein attributed better breeding success in 1974 relative to 1973 to higher water levels in 1974, which increased quality and quantity of nesting habitat.  1973, along with 2010 were considered low water years while 1974 and 2009 were high water years.  In 1973, a low water year, nests were exposed and impacted by high winds, resulting in less nest success than in 1974.  In a low water year at Delta marsh, breeding success was ~50% less than a high water year even if water levels were ~30 cm higher at the start of the nesting season (Nuechterlein 1975).  A sampling of nests for nest success showed that nest success of 84% in 1974 was significantly higher than 49% in 2009 and 43% in 2010.  There were a variety of threats to nests in 2009 and 2010 but the top three were wave impacts, destruction by spawning carp, and abandonment due to low water levels.  The 2009 adult and chick counts include Lake Manitoba because of the channel connection between the two areas.  LaPorte also cites the multi-modality of clutch initiations in 2009 and 2010 to increased rates of nest failures from wave impacts from storms and the renesting that occurs.  Abandonment rates due to researcher disturbance in 2009 and 2010 was greatly reduced by nearly 76% from the 1970s surveys.  LaPorte also states that controlled water drawdowns are also  beneficial to bolster bulrush growth though low water levels negatively impoact grebe nesting."

In 1973, there was low marsh water levels which limited accessible nesting habitat.  It is hypothesized that this caused grebes to nest in less optimal nesting habitat vulnerable to wind and wave inundation.  Predation was not thought to have a major impact on nest success.  However, colonies near canoe passages were vulnerable to human disturbance and nests were abandoned at a higher rate."

Western grebe large body mass relative to other grebes also decreases toxicant metabolism.

Other years’ data was compiled by Mark Lupher, volunteer at DFNWR in 2019. The 2019 to 2021 data was added on by Anne Yen in 2021.  Each year in the 12 year survey varies in terms of # surveys and dates of surveys for that year.  2019 to 2021 included drone use which detected higher number of nests but does not necessarily represent increased nesting than other years.  Nest detection in smartweed is very difficult by boat so nests numbers in other years could be comparably as high as 2019 and 2021 but not found. "

Cavitt has the # breeding birds as the actual count. The June 14, 1993 survey is also included in G. Ivey's ID Waterbird Atlas spreadsheet for his work with Region 1 - Non Game.  In Ivey's spreadsheet, the median number for range of nests is reported as 1 (should be 3 according to Trost) and estimated # of breeding birds at 6 (conversion factor of nests by 2)."

The reports include Western grebe colony counts of each year (except 1979) but only 1977 and 1978 have individual breeding lake survey numbers. The 1980 report summarizes colony status for 5 colonies but does not name them so is entered here as a statewide entry with no breeding lakes named.  There were 5 new breeding lakes reported for 1978.  In 1978, greater water abundance is thought to be the cause of higher Western grebe numbers than at any other time recorded in recent history, therefore low water levels was entered as a threat here.  Twelve sites had approximately 600 pairs, bringing the statewide total to greater or equal to 800 pairs.  In 1977, there were 20 recorded breeding lakes.  In 1978, there were 21 recorded breeding lakes with one inactive.  In 1980, there were 24 recorded breeding lakes with two inactive.  In 1980, five colonies were surveyed but does not state which ones.  Of these five, one was abandoned and there was a decrease in the numbers of breeding birds.  Declines were of 61%, 70%, and 97% in three colonies with an increase at one colony.  No other details provided nor names of grebe lakes.  These efforts were summarized in a 1982 paper cited here."

Except for the western part of BCR 12, there are no historical records for breeding and the species is believed to be a recent arrival in most of the region. Breeding records occur in either sewage ponds or natural shallow wetlands. Species’ presence may be in response to occasional drought conditions farther west in the Dakotas and Nebraska. Small increases in BCRs 22 and 23 in Minnesota are likely attributable to MN DNR’s shallow lake restoration program (e. g., Geneva Lake).

There were 75 Western grebe colonies documented in ND for this inventory.  Colonies under 25 nests were not included in this inventory so actual pair and nest numbers may be higher for ND.  70% of grebe nests were in marsh vegetation with the rest in open water.  Three sites (unnamed) had nests built along busy roads with no sign of negative effects but observers were only on site for a limited time and longer-term effects are possible.  Clark's grebes were observed at some sites but there was no evidence of them breeding.  Threats were summarized generally with no specified breeding lake nor referred species named per threat but there was one documented instance of humans intentionally killing grebes.

He responded to our outreach to him that Upper Klamath Lake was impacted by different challenges from the other sites of the Klamath Basin NWR Complex.  There was a lack of recruitment of juvenile endangered suckers which alters water management.  Water was held higher and at a more stable level than previous years.  However, this negatively impacts submergent and emergent vegetation and reduces nesting habitat.  Remaining stands of emergent vegetation become dislodged and floats away.  Unfortunately, the focus on fish does not consider wetlands, waterbirds, nor the ecological drivers of species declines.  He expressed the need to address these issues at the forefront before additional species are listed, prompting recovery actions. "

Researchers banded 19 Western grebe juveniles and 16 adults in 1973.  Largest reported summer population is here, according to surveys sent out to 5 areas of Utah where >100 Western grebes breed.  The minimum adult and chick counts of 1973 and 1974 are from Table 16 and Table 17 respectively, looking at June through late-August.  840 is reported as the peak adult count between 11 June and 30 July 1974 and 680 is the average of the weekly counts in that period.  I did not include late August and onward counts as the paper called that post-breeding.  Minimum and maximum chick numbers are estimated from Figure 3 starting from mid-June.  This study has separate totals for Class 2 (free swimming) chicks estimated two different ways that I did not enter here.  They are 124 and 158 Class 2 chicks in 1973 and 218 and 269 Class 2 chicks in 1974.  Lindvall calculated nest success using Class 2 chicks per adults.  54% of the total 386 nests were in emergent vegetation, 41% were in open water, and 5% were on dry land.  Table 2 (1973) and Table 3 (1974) provides nest characteristic and nest success data, including threats and their impacts.  Egg predation, nest abandonment, and water level drops are named as the most major threats.  A loss of 25% of total nests to abandonment, including one entire colony, is attributed to a decrease in water levels.  The abandoned colony was located in an area where water level is not managed.

Birds might mistake these for wetlands and could die if they land in these evaporation pools and are covered in oil.  For this study, 9 of 28 COWDFs in Wyoming were conducted to examine mortality of birds.  Grebes (Family Podicipedidae), incl;uding Western grebes, were amongst the most common bird carcass encountered (28% of total mortalities).

Three ranges of breeding population estimates and corresponding year range of surveys are WGFD annual surveys from 2002 to 2006, Wyoming BBS surveys annually 1987 to 2015, and Integrated Monitoring in Bird Conservation Regions (IMBCR) surveys between 2009 to 2015."

Climate change impacts on these wetlands include reduced water availability, higher salinity, reduced snowpack, reduced streamflow, decrease in water quality, reduced lake size, warmer temperatures, drier/drough conditions, etc. Looking at trends in waterbird abundance via USGS BBS (1968-2015) and trends in temperature, precipitation and streamflow (1980-2015 for these), there is a negative relationship for Western and Clark's grebes with temperature (-0.54) and precipitation (-0.28) trends and a positive (0.10 for duration, 0.34 for magnitude) with streamflow trends.
