It is a significant contributor to the regional economy and wetland functioning which could be under threat should it dry out. Millions of migrating birds stop at the GSL to refuel and rest. However, the GSL has diminished in size and water volume to its lowest since monitoring commenced in 1847. Water levels hit a record low during summer of 2022. It is the remnant of an ancient lake, Lake Bonneville. Water flows from the Jordan, Weber, and Bear Rivers, providing water to the Salt Lake City metropolitan area and surrounding agriculture fields before entering the GSL. Water flow is threatened by high water demand from a fast-growing metropolis and climate change effects, resulting in low water levels at the lake which exacerbates dry conditions and increases salinity. High salinity and dry lake beds can kill invertebrates that migrating birds depend on for food. See individual entries for more details.
